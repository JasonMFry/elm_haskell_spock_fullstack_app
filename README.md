# Timed 10-meter Walk Feature

Thank you for accepting the OPIE Software Coding Challenge.  We believe that
the best way to determine how well a candidate will create an experience is to
do one!  We have created a very simple user story for you to demonstrate your
command of UI, UX, API, and software development principles.

What we would like you to do is take this user story and create a small program
that displays your skill.  We would also be interested in any additional
material or information that you wish to include in order to give us an idea of
what to expect from you.

We rely heavily on what you submit to make our decision. This is an “open book
test” so we expect something that is reasonably complete and which stands
alone.  Please do be creative and feel free to do your own research.

## User Story

As a certified Prosthetist, I need to conduct the “Timed 10 Meter Walk Test” on
my patients and record the results in their medical record.  I want a simple
tool to help me conduct the test and keep track of the results for each
patient.

## Design Assumptions

I already know how to conduct the test, so the tool doesn’t need to focus on
teaching me about it. The tool doesn’t need any authentication or security
features. It needs to be easy to use and generate accurate output.  For each
test, it should save the times and a note to a data storage system.

## Focus

Since you have indicated that you have broad experience in development, we
recommend adopting a traditional web-based frontend/backend architecture.
Special attention should be paid to:

- A consistent and intuitive user experience
- Clarity and robustness of front-end code
- API-based storage and retrieval of test results
- Data storage of test results

## Deliverables

The solution you ultimately send to us must contain both the source code for
the solution and any instructions necessary for us to build and run it on our
workstations. We need to see it working!

## Extra Credit

Do a work-tasks break down that shows us how you approached the problem.
